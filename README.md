**PROBLEM STATEMENT**: Farmers in Washington State have faced issues of soil erosion which is depleting their fields of nutrient-rich soil. This has given rise to the necessity in spreading crop residue over their fields after harvest which helps to retain soil among other benefits such as retaining ground moisture, organic matter, and overall soil health. The issue is that determining the percentage of soil coverage by crop residue by hand is a tedious and difficult task. State of the art machine learning models are capable of learning how to accurately predict the coverage percentage of any situation, and perform the task signficantly quicker than manual labor.

## Solution Description:
- Our model utilizes **INSERT PRE-BUILD IMAGE SEGMENTATION MODEL HERE** as a pre-built Deep Neural Network running off of the **INSERT ARCHITECTURE** backbone architecture for accurate image segmentation in order to predict the amount of soil covered by crop residue.
- With great accuracy (**be sure to write about model performance after evaluation**) our model is well-fit to accurately predict the amount of crop residue coverage for any situation.
